Theoria is a C++ Framework for building highly configurable applications that can be monitored in Virtual Reality

## Vision
Imagine you can explore a running program as a Virtual World. Imagine you can dive into the layers of complexity as if you were naviaging a city or a complex building. Imagine if the most relevant information explaining the state of an application was there to see rather than being buried in log files. Imagine being able to visualize the organization of an application - how its components connect and also see this interaction as it happens. This is the vision of Theoria and it is only the beginning.

## Introduction
Theoria allows you to build highly configurable applications composed of interacting components. These components can interact synchronously via direct references or asynchronously via message passing. I wide variety of threading models are provided and you can create your own. Theoria uses TOML for configuration but you can customize the configuration manager if you prefer JSON, YAML, XML or other formats.

You can learn more about Theoria's features and how they are delivered as zero cost abstractions in the sections below. The
